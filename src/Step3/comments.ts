  "I was alarmed to see that during the assessment process detailed in the BAR/EMP, there was no rigorous third-party scientific evaluation of the potential impacts of the prospecting and mining activities to be carried out. It is explicitly stated on pages 52 and 53 of the BMP/EMP that individual specialist reports regarding the impact to soil, fauna & flora, wetlands, surface water, groundwater, and cultural heritage aspects were not conducted “due to the minimal impacts of the proposed activities.” It remains unclear how the Environmental Assessment Practitioner arrived at this conclusion without having carried out such an assessment.",
  "I find it very concerning that there were no individual specialist assessments undertaken to determine the degree of impact of the proposed activities on soil, fauna and flora, surface water, groundwater, and cultural heritage aspects. The BMP/EMP simply states (repeatedly) that the significance of impacts of the proposed activities is “minimal,” but fails to provide adequate evidence to substantiate that claim.",
  "The BMP/EMP provides no evidence of any rigorous environmental assessment that explicitly evaluates the impact of the proposed activities on the area’s soils, vegetation, fauna and waterways. It is clear that the Environmental Assessment Practitioner has failed to carry out a satisfactory and sufficient environmental impact assessment.",

  "The location of the proposed activities at the headwaters of the Doring River is especially concerning. The prospecting site is just over a kilometer from the Twee River, the last outpost for the Critically Endangered Twee River redfin. Already under threat from agricultural pollution, water abstraction and invasive species, the impacts from nearby mining activities could very well be the nail in the coffin for this endemic South African species. Iron and manganese pollution in the Doring River headwaters will also impact downstream populations of the Endangered Clanwilliam sandfish, which exist only in the Doring River and its tributaries. The BMP/EMP fails entirely to include potential impacts to the nearby Twee and Leeu Rivers and the aquatic life found therein, despite the fact that the proposed boreholes are directly adjacent to the waterways, the closest being within 200m.",
  "The proximity of the prospecting site to the Twee River is alarming given the fact that it constitutes the last remaining habitat for the Twee River redfin, a Critically Endangered fish found nowhere else on earth. Moreover, pollution in this part of the Cederberg has the potential to travel far downstream and affect other sensitive species, including the Endangered Clanwilliam sandfish and other fragile indigenous species. I was surprised to see that impacts to aquatic life were entirely excluded from the BMP/EMP, and would like to see a specialist's report carried out by an independent third party aquatic scientist before this project is allowed to continue.",
  "There is a very real risk that the proposed activities will cause the extinction of the Critically Endangered Twee River redfin, a species with an extremely limited distribution of less than 10km which is found directly adjacent to the prospecting location. Pollution here will also impact other sensitive species downstream of the Twee River, including the Clanwilliam sandfish and the Clanwilliam yellowfish, among others. A specialist report assessing the prospecting and mining operation's potential impact on the aquatic life in the Twee and Leeu Rivers, especially on the Twee River redfin, must be carried out by an independent expert before this project proceeds.",

  "Any mining carried out here could very well impact the quality of water in the Groot Winterhoek Strategic Water Source Area, the source of  a disproportionately high amount of our country’s fresh water. As a water-scarce country, this strategic water resource area represents an important life source for South African citizens and for generations to come.

The economic implications of such decisions by other visitors to the Cederberg are significant, especially by the avid fly-fishing community.";
