      <h2>HELP PREVENT ORE MINING IN THE CEDERBERG</h2>

      <p>
        Registering as an Interested and Affected Party (IAP) and sending comments regarding the application by Orren
        Capital (Pty) Ltd and TPR Mining Resources (Pty) Ltd to undertake prospecting activities in the Cederberg
      </p>

      <p>
        Background: Earlier this month (April), TPR Mining Resources (Pty) Ltd posted a public notice on behalf of Orren
        Capital (Pty) Ltd communicating their intention to prospect for iron and manganese near the Twee River in the
        heart of the Cederberg. The map below shows the location of the proposed prospecting activities (-32.67727778°,
        19.29186111°) relative to nearby accommodations and the town of Citrusdal.
      </p>

      <p>
        They have opened up a comment period during which members of the public can register as Interested and Affected
        Parties (IAPs) and send comments regarding the application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why register? As part of an environmental impact assessment, the party running the EIA is required to consider
        comments and concerns from the public. The more registered IAPs, the more it becomes evident that the public
        does not want this to happen. If you include your contact details when you register as an IAP, you will receive
        project updates.
      </p>

        That said, the process has 4 steps:
